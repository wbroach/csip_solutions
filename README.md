## Conceptual Problems

   Today will focus on conceptual computer science knowledge, from theoretical application of Data Structures, to language specific questions and terms. Many interview processes start with a shorter interview, where one can expect these types of quick, punchy questions to appear. These are very common in 'Phone Screens', which are often used to ascertain if a candidate is worth the time of a longer interview. Hopefully you will walk away from this meeting with an expanded knowledge on how to approach these, and what might be asked.

The following is general guidline to thinking about these questions:

### 1. Who is asking

### 2. Identify the scope

### 3. Target your skills
