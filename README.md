## 1301 / 1302 / Taking Data Structures

1) Given a Binary Search Tree, print the values in order
2) Write two functions: one to count the number of nodes, and another to count the number of leaf nodes
3) Write a function that returns the number of levels in a binary tree. The number of levels is equal to the furthest level reached by any leaf node in the tree. 


## Has Taken Data Structures

1) Write a function to insert into a BST.
2) [Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-numbers-formed-root-leaf-paths/)
3) Invert a binary tree   

## Bonus

1) Given a binary tree (represented as an array under the hood), write a method that turns this tree
   into a max heap. You may assume that the binary tree has been filled left-to-right
